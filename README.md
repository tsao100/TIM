# Track Information Modeling (TIM)


The track information modeling (TIM) project is based on the Autodesk Revit Platform plug-in. My target is to make the conveniences of TIM work as much as possible.

Due to Revit is designed for the building, therefore the support for the railway linear structure are very poor. The first task is to implement the function to support the Track Alignment information to be  created in the Revit environment.
