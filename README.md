The track information modeling (TIM) project is based on the Autodesk Revit Platform plug-in. My target is to make the conveniences of TIM work as much as possible.

Due to Revit is designed for the building modeling, therefore the support for the railway linear structure are realy insufficient. Therefore, the first task is to implement the function to support the Track Alignment information to be  created in the Revit environment.

Because of my work, I started teaching my self to use Revit modeling in 2015 and led my technical department to try to use Revit modeling and collaborative work. In the process of using, I realized the power of Revit.
Because I have been engaged in the design and interface work of the track project. In the engineering environment of Taiwan, the track model required by the owner for the track project is ambiguous. Therefore, if it is strictly treated, it will be necessary to align to the building structure with BIM as much as possible. To fulfill the technical support related to design, construction and other operational objectives. Therefore, I also hope that the powerful features of Revit can be applied in the track engineering. But before that, It needs to add Revit's functions to support the track engineering work requirement.

Based on the above ideas, I have been working for a while, learning Revit SDK and developing some simple features posted on this website, I would like to use this to attract friends and volanteers, who will contribution his efforts and to share the functions of this project.

For this project, you can share and contribute to your efforts in the following ways:

1. Provide comments, ideas or related materials, help to translate the document into a language you are familiar with.
2. Directly involved in development.
3. Provide a formula for the transition curve and related test data sheets. [Click](https://github.com/tsao100/TIM/issues/1).
4. Donate.
